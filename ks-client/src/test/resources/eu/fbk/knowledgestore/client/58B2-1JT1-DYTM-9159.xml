FRANCE: Renault will produce 82,000 Nissan Micra in Flins plant.


The Renault Flins plant, located near Paris, France, was selected by Renault to produce the next-generation Nissan Micra. Production will begin in 2016 at an estimated annual volume of 82,000 vehicles.

Nissan, Renault's Alliance partner, requested the French vehicle manufacturer to produce the next-generation Nissan Micra in Europe at a Renault plant.
Renault decided to assign the production to the Flins plant. Renault recently concluded labor negotiations with its union representatives. Entitled "Contract for new growth and social development of Renault in France," the new contract was signed on March 13th and allows Renault to increase the competitiveness of its French plants, and it enabled the company to assign the new Nissan production to the Flins plant.
Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault Group said: "This announcement is good news for Flins, but also for all Renault plants in France. The efforts committed by our employees under the Renault Agreement are beginning to bear fruit. Renault is in line to fulfill its commitments."
Under terms of the agreement, Renault is committed to increase production volume of its French plants by 180,000 vehicles, to 710,000 vehicles per year. The renewal plan calls for 100,000 cars to come from Renault's new products and 80,000 vehicles from partners.
