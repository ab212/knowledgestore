New dealership already planning to expand


THE new face of Kia in Port Lincoln is open for business.
Port Lincoln Kia has opened its new premises on Porter Street, catering for new and used vehicle sales, service and advice.

Sales manager James Benford said it was exciting to finally have the doors open after months of planning and hard work.
"There has not been a Kia dealership in Port Lincoln for more than twelve months and the opportunity to start this business was too good to let go," Mr Benford said.
"We were fortunate to be able to get this site, which has been workable for our business right from the start."
Mr Benford, who moved to Port Lincoln from Adelaide to open the business, said Port Lincoln Kia had extensive renovation plans in the pipeline.
"We are planning to convert the current building into a large showroom with new offices and amenities," he said.
"We will also improve the parts and service departments, and hope to employ more staff as the business grows."
Port Lincoln Kia currently employs five staff including sales representatives, a parts manager, a mechanic, a business manager finance and insurance consultant and a receptionist.
Mr Benford added that the business was also looking to expand its range of new and used cars, with a particular focus on prestige vehicles.
"Kia are a very good brand and have well priced vehicles, and we are looking to complement our core business by offering a range of prestige but affordable cars through trade-ins and late-model trade purchases," he said.
"We have a full range of services for our customers and can provide extensive insurance, trade-in and warranty sales and advice."
"We also have a service department which can handle all repairs, parts, regular servicing and warranty or insurance claims."
