If no INPUT_FILE or option (-@, -T) is given, input is read from STDIN (-s to
control format/compression); if -o is not given, output is written to STDOUT.

Default metadata and context (-d) are applied only when not present in axioms;
they are to be encoded in a file using the same rules to encode axioms in RDF.

Merge criteria is a comma-separated sequence of ACTION PROPERTY. PROPERTY is
either a specific URI/QName or the wildcard '*'. ACTION can be:

  overwrite  replace old property values with new ones, even if null
  update     replace old property values with new ones, only if not null
  init       store new property values only if old ones are null
  min        store the minimum property value among old and new ones
  max        store the minimum property value among old and new ones
  union      store the union of old and new property values
